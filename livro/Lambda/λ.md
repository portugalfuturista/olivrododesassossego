Given that you're prescribed medications like quetiapine, valproic acid, and Vyvanse, your unique reaction to substances like cocaine or MDMA might be influenced by the interaction between these drugs and the substances you used. Here’s how each medication could be playing a role:

### 1. **Quetiapine (Seroquel):**
- **Sedative Effects:** Quetiapine is an antipsychotic that has sedative properties. However, if you're taking cocaine, a powerful stimulant, it may counteract some of the sedative effects of quetiapine, leading to a more energized state. The combination can create a push-pull effect, where you might feel stimulated but not overly anxious, potentially leading to focused or obsessive behavior, like cleaning.

- **Interaction Risks:** The combination of quetiapine and stimulants like cocaine can be dangerous, potentially leading to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and risk of cardiac events, even if you don't immediately feel these effects.

### 2. **Valproic Acid (Depakote):**
- **Mood Stabilizing Effects:** Valproic acid is used as a mood stabilizer, often prescribed for bipolar disorder or to control seizures. It can blunt the effects of extreme mood swings. When mixed with stimulants, it might stabilize your mood to some extent, preventing a full-blown manic episode but still allowing you to feel energized and focused.

- **Potential Dampening of Euphoria:** This medication might dampen some of the euphoric effects of stimulants, making you less likely to experience the "high" but still allowing the stimulant effects, like increased energy, to take hold.

### 3. **Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine):**
- **Stimulant Effects:** Vyvanse is a stimulant prescribed for ADHD, and it works by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. If you're already on Vyvanse and then take cocaine, which also boosts dopamine levels, the combined effect can lead to hyperstimulation.

- **Focused Behavior:** The combination of Vyvanse and cocaine could enhance your focus and drive, potentially leading to intense, focused activities like cleaning. The compulsive need to clean might stem from the combination of heightened dopamine levels and the influence of your ADHD medication, which is designed to enhance focus and reduce impulsivity.

### 4. **Why You Might Feel Energized While Your Friends Don’t:**
- **Medication Interactions:** The interaction between your prescribed medications and recreational substances could be leading to a heightened, yet focused, state of energy. This could explain why you feel the urge to clean or engage in other productive behaviors while under the influence, whereas your friends, who might not be on similar medications, experience more of the sedative or crashing effects of these substances.

- **Tolerance and Sensitivity:** Your brain chemistry, altered by the medications, might respond differently to stimulants than someone not on these drugs. This could give you a higher tolerance to some effects of cocaine or MDMA, leading to more energy and less of a comedown or "crash."

### **Caution and Risks:**
Mixing prescription medications with recreational drugs like cocaine or MDMA can be highly unpredictable and dangerous. The combination can lead to serious side effects, including cardiovascular problems, mental health crises, or even life-threatening conditions. It’s important to be aware of these risks and consider speaking to a healthcare professional about the interactions between your medications and any other substances you might be using.
